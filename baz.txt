This is how you go from viewing some stapled writing back to the original file for editing. The staple view is good for proofreading and creating a final export, but not editing.

Now type C-c ; to go back to the sidebar and z to open its notes. Add or change the notes and type C-c C-c or C-x C-s. To quit the notes window without saving, type either C-c C-q or C-c C-k.

You can toggle the notes window without selecting it by pressing i.

To really mix things up, open the notes window again and, with it selected, type C-c C-l. This pops the window out to be a regular window (instead of a side-window). This works as a toggle.

Your binder is not just for writing, but also references, type C-c ] to view a reference image.*


* your Emacs may not support images :(
